# About Me
Hi, I am a Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://mgmt.hkust.edu.hk/" target="_blank" style="color:blue"> the Department of Management, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</a>. I am on the 2023–2024 management job market and expect to graduate under the supervison of <a href="https://mgmt.hkust.edu.hk/faculty-and-staff/directory/mnjtli" target="_blank" style="color:blue"> Prof. J.T. LI</a> before Aug 2024.

My research investigates the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) activities of organizations, with a focus on how these activities affect their strategic choices and outcomes. I am currently studying three streams of thought related to this overarching theme: 
 1. The consequences of organizations’ and individuals’ social engagements on their business operations or career trajectories;
 2. The impact of executive succession planning on firms’ strategic choices;
 3. The influence of climate pledges on firms’ carbon footprints.

I primarily rely on quantitative analysis of large-scale datasets but also use experiments, text analysis, and qualitative data sources, including field interviews to gain deeper insights into the mechanisms at play. I explore these questions across a range of contexts: Chinese brokerage houses’ participation in poverty alleviation, family businesses’ acquisitions, multinational corporations’ carbon footprints, and artists’ careers in the South Korean film industry.

# Job Market Paper
* <b>Learning by Helping: Evidence from Chinese Brokerages’ Community-based CSR</b> 
  * Community-based corporate social responsibility (CSR) can bring various benefits to participating firms. My paper investigates how CSR facilitates participating firms’ access to valuable local knowledge through ground-level experiences. I study a sample of Chinese brokerage houses quasi-randomly assigned to help impoverished communities in a pairing assistance program as a part of China’s Targeted Poverty Alleviation policy. I find that brokerages’ community CSR participation increases the accuracy of their forecasts for companies' future earnings in the regions they helped.
